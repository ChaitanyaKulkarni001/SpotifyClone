## 🛠 Setup & Installation

###  Clone Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/ChaitanyaKulkarni001/SpotifyClone.git
cd SpotifyClone
```



## 📡 Hosting Songs on GitHub (Raw URLs)
Since GitHub Pages doesn’t serve folders, songs are fetched via **GitHub Raw URLs**:

```js
currentSong.src = `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChaitanyaKulkarni001/SpotifyClone/master/Songs/${currentFolder}/${songs[currentIndex]}`;
currentSong.play();
```
